      <h1>Student-Driven Perspectives of AI Policy In a Design Classroom</h1>
      
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This project, <b>Student-Driven Perspectives of AI Policy in a Design Classroom</b>, investigates how students, as early adopters of generative AI, perceive and shape AI-related policies in a design classroom setting. Although AI policies in higher education are typically developed by faculty and administrators, students are the ones actively experimenting with and integrating GenAI tools into their learning workflows. Yet their voices are often absent from formal policy development. This research addresses that gap by centering student perspectives in the co-creation of GenAI classroom policies, aiming to produce guidelines that are ethical, inclusive, and grounded in real-world learning practices.</p>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>With the increasing integration of generative AI in education, policies governing its use are often created without direct student input. This gap can lead to policies that do not align with students' needs or learning experiences. This project aims to address this issue by developing student-authored AI policies that balance innovation, ethical use, and academic integrity. By understanding how students perceive AI and its role in their coursework, this research provides actionable insights that can inform future AI policies in design education..</p>

      <h2>User & Audiences</h2>
      <p><b>Primary users:</b> students in <i>HCC629: Fundamentals of Human-Centered Computing</i>. The findings benefit university administrators, educators, policymakers, and future students in design courses.</p>
      <p><b>Audiences:</b> Faculty designing GenAI-integrated curricula, university administrators developing institutional AI policies, and HCI researchers studying participatory policy design and AI ethics </p>
      
      <h2>Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
        <p><b>My Role:</b> Graduate Student Researcher</p>
        <p><b>Team Members:</b> Dr. Yasmine Kotturi (PI), Manisha Vijay (Graduate Research Assistant)</p>
        <p><b>Responsibilities:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Designed and co-facilitated a 3-part participatory workshop series with 8 student participants</li>
            <li>Developed IRB Protocol and managed compensations for participants</li>
            <li>conducting qualitative thematic analysis on workshops' audio transcriptions</li>
            <li>Coordinating the curation of final policy artifacts, including zines and redesigned GenAI interface mockups</li>
            <li>Preparing the study for academic publication (targeting <b><CHI 2026/b> or <b>DIS 2026</b>)</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Scope & Constraints</h2>
      <p><b>Timeline:</b> January 1, 2025 – December 31, 2025</p>
      <p><b>Participants:</b> 8 students from Fall 2024 *HCC629* taught by Dr. Yasmine Kotturi (PI)</p>
      <p><b>Constraints:</b> Limited to UMBC students and design courses</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Recruitment & Consent:</b> Screening surveys, participant consent</li>
        <li><b>Workshop 1 (3/28/2025):</b> Brainstorming policy recommendations through candid conversations  
           <ul>
            <li>Students shared how they currently use GenAI, reflecting on ethical concerns, creativity, and integrity by employing Think-Pair-Share excercise.</li>
            <li>Student chose policy topics and brainstormed police recommendations what they would want to have in design classes</li>
           </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Workshop 2 (4/11/2025):</b> Curating policy recommendations through student-authored zine making
           <ul>  
             <li> Students evaluated others' AI policy recommendations and identified rooms for improvement to make it actionable and concrete</li>
             <li> Students express their own AI policy recommendations to physical zines and digital ones on Figma</li> 
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Workshop 3 (4/25/2025):</b> Applying policy recommendations through interface redesign activity
           <ul>
             <li>Students shared their own zines and evaluated others</li>
             <li>Students redesigned their picked GenAI tool by applying metaphor and learning objectives to facilitate the AI policy</li>
           </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Data Analysis:</b> Conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis on surveys, discussions, and interviews</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2> Next Steps </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete qualitative analysis of workshop transcripts and interviews</li>
        <li>Finalize and circulate the curated zines on campus</li>
        <li>Present findings in research paper</li>
        <li>Building on this research, I will develop my Master’s thesis in Human-Centered Computing at UMBC, continuing to explore student-centered AI policy and the broader implications of generative AI in design education.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Outcomes & Results</h2>
      <p>To be determined in 2025.</p>
